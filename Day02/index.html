# Kubernetes concepts

- Kubernetes is a container management system

- It runs and manages containerized applications on a cluster

--

- What does that really mean?

.debug[[k8s/concepts-k8s.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## What can we do with Kubernetes?

- Let's imagine that we have a 3-tier e-commerce app:

  - web frontend

  - API backend

  - database (that we will keep out of Kubernetes for now)

- We have built images for our frontend and backend components

  (e.g. with Dockerfiles and `docker build`)

- We are running them successfully with a local environment

  (e.g. with Docker Compose)

- Let's see how we would deploy our app on Kubernetes!

.debug[[k8s/concepts-k8s.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/concepts-k8s.md)]
---


## Basic things we can ask Kubernetes to do

--

- Start 5 containers using image `demo/backend:v1.0`

--

- Place an internal load balancer in front of these containers

--

- Start 10 containers using image `demo/frontend:v1.3`

--

- Place a public load balancer in front of these containers

--

- It's Black Friday (or Christmas), traffic spikes, grow our cluster and add containers

--

- New release! Replace my containers with the new image `demo/frontend:v1.4`

--

- Keep processing requests during the upgrade; update my containers one at a time

.debug[[k8s/concepts-k8s.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## Other things that Kubernetes can do for us

- Autoscaling

  (straightforward on CPU; more complex on other metrics)

- Resource management and scheduling

  (reserve CPU/RAM for containers; placement constraints)

- Advanced rollout patterns

  (blue/green deployment, canary deployment)

.debug[[k8s/concepts-k8s.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## More things that Kubernetes can do for us

- Batch jobs

- Fine-grained access control


- Stateful services


- Automating complex tasks with *operators*

# Kubernetes Architecture

.debug[[k8s/concepts-k8s.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## Kubernetes Architecture: The Worker Nodes

- The nodes executing our containers run a collection of services:

  - a container Engine (typically Docker)

  - kubelet (the "node agent")

  - kube-proxy (a necessary but not sufficient network component)

- Nodes were formerly called "minions"

  (You might see that word in older articles or documentation)

.debug[[k8s/concepts-k8s.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

## Kubernetes Architecture: The Control Plane


- The Kubernetes logic (its "brains") is a collection of services:

  - the API server (our point of entry to everything!)

  - core services like the scheduler and controller manager

  - `etcd` (a highly available key/value store; the "database" of Kubernetes)

- Together, these services form the control plane of our cluster

- The control plane is also called the "master"

.debug[[k8s/concepts-k8s.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## How many nodes should a cluster have?

- There is no particular constraint

  (no need to have an odd number of nodes for quorum)

- A cluster can have zero node

  (but then it won't be able to start any pods)

- For testing and development, having a single node is fine

- For production, make sure that you have extra capacity

  (so that your workload still fits if you lose a node or a group of nodes)

- Kubernetes is tested with [up to 5000 nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/best-practices/cluster-large/)

  (however, running a cluster of that size requires a lot of tuning)

.debug[[k8s/concepts-k8s.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/concepts-k8s.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Do we need to run Docker at all?

No!

--

- By default, Kubernetes uses the Docker Engine to run containers

- We can leverage other pluggable runtimes through the *Container Runtime Interface*

.debug[[k8s/concepts-k8s.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/concepts-k8s.md)]
---


## Interacting with Kubernetes

- We will interact with our Kubernetes cluster through the Kubernetes API

- The Kubernetes API is (mostly) RESTful

- It allows us to create, read, update, delete *resources*

- A few common resource types are:

  - node (a machine — physical or virtual — in our cluster)

  - pod (group of containers running together on a node)

  - service (stable network endpoint to connect to one or multiple containers)

# Setting up Kubernetes

- Kubernetes is made of many components that require careful configuration

- Secure operation typically requires TLS certificates and a local CA

  (certificate authority)

- Setting up everything manually is possible, but rarely done

  (except for learning purposes)

- Let's do a quick overview of available options!

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## Local development

- Examples: Docker Desktop, k3d, KinD, MicroK8s, Minikube

  (some of these also support clusters with multiple nodes)

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## Managed clusters

- Many cloud providers and hosting providers offer "managed Kubernetes"

- The deployment and maintenance of the cluster is entirely managed by the provider

  (ideally, clusters can be spun up automatically through an API, CLI, or web interface)

- Given the complexity of Kubernetes, this approach is *strongly recommended*

  (at least for your first production clusters)

- After working for a while with Kubernetes, you will be better equipped to decide:

  - whether to operate it yourself or use a managed offering

  - which offering or which distribution works best for you and your needs

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

class: pic

![managed](images/managedhosts.png)

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## Kubernetes distributions and installers

- If you want to run Kubernetes yourselves, there are many options

  (free, commercial, proprietary, open source ...)

- Some of them are installers, while some are complete platforms

- Some of them leverage other well-known deployment tools

  (like Puppet, Terraform ...)

- A good starting point to explore these options is this [guide](https://v1-16.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/setup/#production-environment)

  (it defines categories like "managed", "turnkey" ...)

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## kubeadm

- kubeadm is a tool part of Kubernetes to facilitate cluster setup

- Many other installers and distributions use it (but not all of them)

- It can also be used by itself

- Excellent starting point to install Kubernetes on your own machines

  (virtual, physical, it doesn't matter)

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## Manual setup

- The resources below are mainly for educational purposes!

- [Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) by Kelsey Hightower

  - step by step guide to install Kubernetes on Google Cloud

  - covers certificates, high availability ...

  - *“Kubernetes The Hard Way is optimized for learning, which means taking the long route to ensure you understand each task required to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster.”*

- [Deep Dive into Kubernetes Internals for Builders and Operators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KtEAa7_duA)

  - conference presentation showing step-by-step control plane setup

  - emphasis on simplicity, not on security and availability

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)

- Supports many [drivers](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/)

  (HyperKit, Hyper-V, KVM, VirtualBox, but also Docker and many others)

- Can deploy a single cluster; recent versions can deploy multiple nodes

- Great option if you want a "Kubernetes first" experience

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## Deploying a managed cluster

*"The easiest way to install Kubernetes is to get someone
else to do it for you."

- Let's see a few options to install managed clusters!

- This is not an exhaustive list

  (the goal is to show the actual steps to get started)

- The list is sorted alphabetically

- All the options mentioned here require an account
with a cloud provider

- ... And a credit card

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## AKS (initial setup)

- Install the Azure CLI

- Login:
  ```bash
  az login
  ```

- Select a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=kubernetes-service&regions=all
)

- Create a "resource group":
  ```bash
  az group create --name my-aks-group --location westeurope
  ```

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---
## AKS (create cluster)

- Create the cluster:
  ```bash
  az aks create --resource-group my-aks-group --name my-aks-cluster
  ```

- Wait about 5-10 minutes

- Add credentials to `kubeconfig`:
  ```bash
  az aks get-credentials --resource-group my-aks-group --name my-aks-cluster
  ```

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## AKS (cleanup)

- Delete the cluster:
  ```bash
  az aks delete --resource-group my-aks-group --name my-aks-cluster
  ```

- Delete the resource group:
  ```bash
  az group delete --resource-group my-aks-group
  ```

- Note: delete actions can take a while too!

  (5-10 minutes as well)

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## Amazon EKS (the old way)

- [Read the doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-console.html)

- Create service roles, VPCs, and a bunch of other oddities

- Try to figure out why it doesn't work

- Start over, following an [official AWS blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-eks-now-generally-available/)

- Try to find the missing Cloud Formation template

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## Amazon EKS (the new way)

- Install `eksctl`

- Set the usual environment variables

  ([AWS_DEFAULT_REGION](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#eks_region), AWS_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)

- Create the cluster:
  ```bash
  eksctl create cluster
  ```

- Cluster can take a long time to be ready (15-20 minutes is typical)

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## Amazon EKS (cleanup)

- Delete the cluster:
  ```bash
  eksctl delete cluster <clustername>
  ```

- If you need to find the name of the cluster:
  ```bash
  eksctl get clusters
  ```

.footnote[Note: the AWS documentation has been updated and now includes [eksctl instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html).]

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## Amazon EKS (notes)

- Convenient if you *have to* use AWS

- Needs extra steps to be truly production-ready

- Versions tend to be outdated

- The only officially supported pod network is the [Amazon VPC CNI plugin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-networking.html)

  - integrates tightly with security groups and VPC networking

  - not suitable for high density clusters (with many small pods on big nodes)

  - other plugins [should still work](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/alternate-cni-plugins.html) but will require extra work

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## GKE (initial setup)

- Install `gcloud`

- Login:
  ```bash
  gcloud auth init
  ```

- Create a "project":
  ```bash
  gcloud projects create my-gke-project
  gcloud config set project my-gke-project
  ```

- Pick a [region](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/)

  (example: `europe-west1`, `us-west1`, ...)

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## GKE (create cluster)

- Create the cluster:
  ```bash
  gcloud container clusters create my-gke-cluster --region us-west1 --num-nodes=2
  ```

  (without `--num-nodes` you might exhaust your IP address quota!)

- The first time you try to create a cluster in a given project, you get an error

  - you need to enable the Kubernetes Engine API
  - the error message gives you a link
  - follow the link and enable the API (and billing)
    <br/>(it's just a couple of clicks and it's instantaneous)

- Clutser should be ready in a couple of minutes

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## GKE (cleanup)

- List clusters (if you forgot its name):
  ```bash
  gcloud container clusters list
  ```

- Delete the cluster:
  ```bash
  gcloud container clusters delete my-gke-cluster --region us-west1
  ```

- Delete the project (optional):
  ```bash
  gcloud projects delete my-gke-project
  ```

.debug[[k8s/setup-overview.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/setup-overview.md)]
---

## GKE (notes)

- Well-rounded product overall

  (it used to be one of the best managed Kubernetes offerings available;
  now that many other providers entered the game, that title is debatable)

- The cluster comes with many add-ons

- Versions lag a bit:

  - latest minor version (e.g. 1.18) tends to be unsupported
 
  - previous minor version (e.g. 1.17) supported through alpha channel

  - previous versions (e.g. 1.14-1.16) supported

# Kubectl

- `kubectl` is (almost) the only tool we'll need to talk to Kubernetes

- It is a rich CLI tool around the Kubernetes API

  (Everything you can do with `kubectl`, you can do directly with the API)

- On our machines, there is a `~/.kube/config` file with:

  - the Kubernetes API address

  - the path to our TLS certificates used to authenticate

- You can also use the `--kubeconfig` flag to pass a config file

- Or directly `--server`, `--user`, etc.

- `kubectl` can be pronounced "Cube C T L", "Cube cuttle", "Cube cuddle"...

class: extra-details

## `kubectl` is the new SSH

- We often start managing servers with SSH

  (installing packages, troubleshooting ...)

- At scale, it becomes tedious, repetitive, error-prone

- Instead, we use config management, central logging, etc.

- In many cases, we still need SSH:

  - as the underlying access method (e.g. Ansible)

  - to debug tricky scenarios

  - to inspect and poke at things

## The parallel with `kubectl`

- We often start managing Kubernetes clusters with `kubectl`

  (deploying applications, troubleshooting ...)

- At scale (with many applications or clusters), it becomes tedious, repetitive, error-prone

- Instead, we use automated pipelines, observability tooling, etc.

- In many cases, we still need `kubectl`:

  - to debug tricky scenarios

  - to inspect and poke at things

- The Kubernetes API is always the underlying access method

## `kubectl get`

- Let's look at our `Node` resources with `kubectl get`!

.exercise[

- Look at the composition of our cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl get node
  ```

- These commands are equivalent:
  ```bash
  kubectl get no
  kubectl get node
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Obtaining machine-readable output

- `kubectl get` can output JSON, YAML, or be directly formatted

.exercise[

- Give us more info about the nodes:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes -o wide
  ```

- Let's have some YAML:
  ```bash
  kubectl get no -o yaml
  ```
  See that `kind: List` at the end? It's the type of our result!

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## (Ab)using `kubectl` and `jq`

- It's super easy to build custom reports

.exercise[

- Show the capacity of all our nodes as a stream of JSON objects:
  ```bash
    kubectl get nodes -o json |
            jq ".items[] | {name:.metadata.name} + .status.capacity"
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Exploring types and definitions

- We can list all available resource types by running `kubectl api-resources`
  <br/>
  (In Kubernetes 1.10 and prior, this command used to be `kubectl get`)

- We can view the definition for a resource type with:
  ```bash
  kubectl explain type
  ```

- We can view the definition of a field in a resource, for instance:
  ```bash
  kubectl explain node.spec
  ```

- Or get the full definition of all fields and sub-fields:
  ```bash
  kubectl explain node --recursive
  ```

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Introspection vs. documentation

- We can access the same information by reading the [API documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/#api-reference)

- The API documentation is usually easier to read, but:

  - it won't show custom types (like Custom Resource Definitions)

  - we need to make sure that we look at the correct version

- `kubectl api-resources` and `kubectl explain` perform *introspection*

  (they communicate with the API server and obtain the exact type definitions)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Type names

- The most common resource names have three forms:

  - singular (e.g. `node`, `service`, `deployment`)

  - plural (e.g. `nodes`, `services`, `deployments`)

  - short (e.g. `no`, `svc`, `deploy`)

- Some resources do not have a short name

- `Endpoints` only have a plural form

  (because even a single `Endpoints` resource is actually a list of endpoints)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Viewing details

- We can use `kubectl get -o yaml` to see all available details

- However, YAML output is often simultaneously too much and not enough

- For instance, `kubectl get node node1 -o yaml` is:

  - too much information (e.g.: list of images available on this node)

  - not enough information (e.g.: doesn't show pods running on this node)

  - difficult to read for a human operator

- For a comprehensive overview, we can use `kubectl describe` instead

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## `kubectl describe`

- `kubectl describe` needs a resource type and (optionally) a resource name

- It is possible to provide a resource name *prefix*

  (all matching objects will be displayed)

- `kubectl describe` will retrieve some extra information about the resource

.exercise[

- Look at the information available for `node1` with one of the following commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe node/node1
  kubectl describe node node1
  ```

]

(We should notice a bunch of control plane pods.)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Listing running containers

- Containers are manipulated through *pods*

- A pod is a group of containers:

 - running together (on the same node)

 - sharing resources (RAM, CPU; but also network, volumes)

.exercise[

- List pods on our cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

--

*Where are the pods that we saw just a moment earlier?!?*

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Namespaces

- Namespaces allow us to segregate resources

.exercise[

- List the namespaces on our cluster with one of these commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl get namespaces
  kubectl get namespace
  kubectl get ns
  ```

]

--

*You know what ... This `kube-system` thing looks suspicious.*

*In fact, I'm pretty sure it showed up earlier, when we did:*

`kubectl describe node node1`

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Accessing namespaces

- By default, `kubectl` uses the `default` namespace

- We can see resources in all namespaces with `--all-namespaces`

.exercise[

- List the pods in all namespaces:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
  ```

- Since Kubernetes 1.14, we can also use `-A` as a shorter version:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -A
  ```

]

*Here are our system pods!*

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## What are all these control plane pods?

- `etcd` is our etcd server

- `kube-apiserver` is the API server

- `kube-controller-manager` and `kube-scheduler` are other control plane components

- `coredns` provides DNS-based service discovery ([replacing kube-dns as of 1.11](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/07/10/coredns-ga-for-kubernetes-cluster-dns/))

- `kube-proxy` is the (per-node) component managing port mappings and such

- `weave` is the (per-node) component managing the network overlay

- the `READY` column indicates the number of containers in each pod

  (1 for most pods, but `weave` has 2, for instance)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Scoping another namespace

- We can also look at a different namespace (other than `default`)

.exercise[

- List only the pods in the `kube-system` namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system
  kubectl get pods -n kube-system
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Namespaces and other `kubectl` commands

- We can use `-n`/`--namespace` with almost every `kubectl` command

- Example:

  - `kubectl create --namespace=X` to create something in namespace X

- We can use `-A`/`--all-namespaces` with most commands that manipulate multiple objects

- Examples:

  - `kubectl delete` can delete resources across multiple namespaces

  - `kubectl label` can add/remove/update labels across multiple namespaces

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## What about `kube-public`?

.exercise[

- List the pods in the `kube-public` namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-public get pods
  ```

]

Nothing!

`kube-public` is created by kubeadm & [used for security bootstrapping](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/01/stronger-foundation-for-creating-and-managing-kubernetes-clusters).

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Exploring `kube-public`

- The only interesting object in `kube-public` is a ConfigMap named `cluster-info`

.exercise[

- List ConfigMap objects:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-public get configmaps
  ```

- Inspect `cluster-info`:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n kube-public get configmap cluster-info -o yaml
  ```

]

Note the `selfLink` URI: `/api/v1/namespaces/kube-public/configmaps/cluster-info`

We can use that!

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Accessing `cluster-info`

- Earlier, when trying to access the API server, we got a `Forbidden` message

- But `cluster-info` is readable by everyone (even without authentication)

.exercise[

- Retrieve `cluster-info`:
  ```bash
  curl -k https://10.96.0.1/api/v1/namespaces/kube-public/configmaps/cluster-info
  ```

]

- We were able to access `cluster-info` (without auth)

- It contains a `kubeconfig` file

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Retrieving `kubeconfig`

- We can easily extract the `kubeconfig` file from this ConfigMap

.exercise[

- Display the content of `kubeconfig`:
  ```bash
    curl -sk https://10.96.0.1/api/v1/namespaces/kube-public/configmaps/cluster-info \
         | jq -r .data.kubeconfig
  ```

]

- This file holds the canonical address of the API server, and the public key of the CA

- This file *does not* hold client keys or tokens

- This is not sensitive information, but allows us to establish trust

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## What about `kube-node-lease`?

- Starting with Kubernetes 1.14, there is a `kube-node-lease` namespace

  (or in Kubernetes 1.13 if the NodeLease feature gate is enabled)

- That namespace contains one Lease object per node

- *Node leases* are a new way to implement node heartbeats

  (i.e. node regularly pinging the control plane to say "I'm alive!")

- For more details, see [KEP-0009] or the [node controller documentation]

[KEP-0009]: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/0009-node-heartbeat.md
[node controller documentation]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/#node-controller

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Services

- A *service* is a stable endpoint to connect to "something"

  (In the initial proposal, they were called "portals")

.exercise[

- List the services on our cluster with one of these commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl get services
  kubectl get svc
  ```

]

--

There is already one service on our cluster: the Kubernetes API itself.

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## ClusterIP services

- A `ClusterIP` service is internal, available from the cluster only

- This is useful for introspection from within containers

.exercise[

- Try to connect to the API:
  ```bash
  curl -k https://`10.96.0.1`
  ```

  - `-k` is used to skip certificate verification

  - Make sure to replace 10.96.0.1 with the CLUSTER-IP shown by `kubectl get svc`

]

The command above should either time out, or show an authentication error. Why?

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Time out

- Connections to ClusterIP services only work *from within the cluster*

- If we are outside the cluster, the `curl` command will probably time out

  (Because the IP address, e.g. 10.96.0.1, isn't routed properly outside the cluster)

- This is the case with most "real" Kubernetes clusters

- To try the connection from within the cluster, we can use [shpod](https://github.com/jpetazzo/shpod)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Authentication error

This is what we should see when connecting from within the cluster:
```json
$ curl -k https://10.96.0.1
{
  "kind": "Status",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {

  },
  "status": "Failure",
  "message": "forbidden: User \"system:anonymous\" cannot get path \"/\"",
  "reason": "Forbidden",
  "details": {

  },
  "code": 403
}
```

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## Explanations

- We can see `kind`, `apiVersion`, `metadata`

- These are typical of a Kubernetes API reply

- Because we *are* talking to the Kubernetes API

- The Kubernetes API tells us "Forbidden"

  (because it requires authentication)

- The Kubernetes API is reachable from within the cluster

  (many apps integrating with Kubernetes will use this)

.debug[[k8s/kubectlget.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectlget.md)]
---

## DNS integration

- Each service also gets a DNS record

- The Kubernetes DNS resolver is available *from within pods*

  (and sometimes, from within nodes, depending on configuration)

- Code running in pods can connect to services using their name

  (e.g. https://servicename/...)

# Labels and Annotations

- Most Kubernetes resources can have *labels* and *annotations*

- Both labels and annotations are arbitrary strings

  (with some limitations that we'll explain in a minute)

- Both labels and annotations can be added, removed, changed, dynamically

- This can be done with:

  - the `kubectl edit` command

  - the `kubectl label` and `kubectl annotate`

  - ... many other ways! (`kubectl apply -f`, `kubectl patch`, ...)

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

## Viewing labels and annotations

- Let's see what we get when we create a Deployment

.exercise[

- Create a Deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment clock --image=ahmedgabercod/clock
  ```

- Look at its annotations and labels:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe deployment clock
  ```

]

So, what do we get?

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

## Labels and annotations for our Deployment

- We see one label:
  ```
  Labels: app=clock
  ```

- This is added by `kubectl create deployment`

- And one annotation:
  ```
  Annotations: deployment.kubernetes.io/revision: 1
  ```

- This is to keep track of successive versions when doing rolling updates

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

## And for the related Pod?

- Let's look up the Pod that was created and check it too

.exercise[

- Find the name of the Pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

- Display its information:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod clock-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy
  ```

]

So, what do we get?

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

## Labels and annotations for our Pod

- We see two labels:
  ```
    Labels: app=clock
            pod-template-hash=xxxxxxxxxx
  ```

- `app=clock` comes from `kubectl create deployment` too

- `pod-template-hash` was assigned by the Replica Set

  (when we will do rolling updates, each set of Pods will have a different hash)

- There are no annotations:
  ```
  Annotations: <none>
  ```

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

## Selectors

- A *selector* is an expression matching labels

- It will restrict a command to the objects matching *at least* all these labels

.exercise[

- List all the pods with at least `app=clock`:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --selector=app=clock
  ```

- List all the pods with a label `app`, regardless of its value:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --selector=app
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

## Settings labels and annotations

- The easiest method is to use `kubectl label` and `kubectl annotate`

.exercise[

- Set a label on the `clock` Deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl label deployment clock color=blue
  ```

- Check it out:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe deployment clock
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

## Other ways to view labels

- `kubectl get` gives us a couple of useful flags to check labels

- `kubectl get --show-labels` shows all labels

- `kubectl get -L xyz` shows the value of label `xyz`

.exercise[

- List all the labels that we have on pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --show-labels
  ```

- List the value of label `app` on these pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -L app
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## More on selectors

- If a selector has multiple labels, it means "match at least these labels"

  Example: `--selector=app=frontend,release=prod`

- `--selector` can be abbreviated as `-l` (for **l**abels)

  We can also use negative selectors

  Example: `--selector=app!=clock`

- Selectors can be used with most `kubectl` commands

  Examples: `kubectl delete`, `kubectl label`, ...

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

## Other ways to view labels

- We can use the `--show-labels` flag with `kubectl get`

.exercise[

- Show labels for a bunch of objects:
  ```bash
  kubectl get --show-labels po,rs,deploy,svc,no
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/labels-annotations.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/labels-annotations.md)]
---

## Differences between labels and annotations

- The *key* for both labels and annotations:

  - must start and end with a letter or digit

  - can also have `.` `-` `_` (but not in first or last position)

  - can be up to 63 characters, or 253 + `/` + 63

- Label *values* are up to 63 characters, with the same restrictions

- Annotations *values* can have arbitrary characters (yes, even binary)

- Maximum length isn't defined

  (dozens of kilobytes is fine, hundreds maybe not so much)

# Deployments

- First things first: we cannot run a container

--

- We are going to run a pod, and in that pod there will be a single container

--

- In that container in the pod, we are going to run a simple `ping` command

--

- Sounds simple enough, right?

--

- Except ... that the `kubectl run` command changed in Kubernetes 1.18!

- We'll explain what has changed, and why

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Choose your own adventure

- First, let's check which version of Kubernetes we're running

.exercise[

- Check our API server version:
  ```bash
  kubectl version
  ```

- Look at the **Server Version** in the second part of the output

]

- In the following slides, we will talk about 1.17- or 1.18+

  (to indicate "up to Kubernetes 1.17" and "from Kubernetes 1.18")

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Starting a simple pod with `kubectl run`

- `kubectl run` is convenient to start a single pod

- We need to specify at least a *name* and the image we want to use

- Optionally, we can specify the command to run in the pod

.exercise[

- Let's ping the address of `localhost`, the loopback interface:
  ```bash
  kubectl run pingpong --image alpine ping 127.0.0.1
  ```

<!-- ```hide kubectl wait pod --selector=run=pingpong --for condition=ready``` -->

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## What do we see?

- In Kubernetes 1.18+, the output tells us that a Pod is created:
  ```
  pod/pingpong created
  ```

- In Kubernetes 1.17-, the output is much more verbose:
  ```
  kubectl run --generator=deployment/apps.v1 is DEPRECATED 
  and will be removed in a future version. Use kubectl run 
  --generator=run-pod/v1 or kubectl create instead.
  deployment.apps/pingpong created
  ```

- There is a deprecation warning ...

- ... And a Deployment was created instead of a Pod

🤔 What does that mean?

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Show me all you got!

- What resources were created by `kubectl run`?

.exercise[

- Let's ask Kubernetes to show us *all* the resources:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

]

Note: `kubectl get all` is a lie. It doesn't show everything.

(But it shows a lot of "usual suspects", i.e. commonly used resources.)

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## The situation with Kubernetes 1.18+

```
NAME           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/pingpong   1/1     Running   0          9s

NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1    <none>        443/TCP   3h30m
```

We wanted a pod, we got a pod, named `pingpong`. Great!

(We can ignore `service/kubernetes`, it was already there before.)

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## The situation with Kubernetes 1.17-

```
NAME                            READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
pod/pingpong-6ccbc77f68-kmgfn   1/1     Running       0          11s

NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1    <none>        443/TCP   3h45

NAME                       READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/pingpong   1/1     1            1           11s

replicaset.apps/pingpong-6ccbc77f68   1         1         1       11s
```

Our pod is not named `pingpong`, but `pingpong-xxxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy`.

We have a Deployment named `pingpong`, and an extra Replica Set, too. What's going on?

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## From Deployment to Pod

We have the following resources:

- `deployment.apps/pingpong`

  This is the Deployment that we just created.

- `replicaset.apps/pingpong-xxxxxxxxxx`

  This is a Replica Set created by this Deployment.

- `pod/pingpong-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy`

  This is a *pod* created by the Replica Set.

Let's explain what these things are.

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Pod

- Can have one or multiple containers

- Runs on a single node

  (Pod cannot "straddle" multiple nodes)

- Pods cannot be moved

  (e.g. in case of node outage)

- Pods cannot be scaled

  (except by manually creating more Pods)

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Pod details

- A Pod is not a process; it's an environment for containers

  - it cannot be "restarted"

  - it cannot "crash"

- The containers in a Pod can crash

- They may or may not get restarted

  (depending on Pod's restart policy)

- If all containers exit successfully, the Pod ends in "Succeeded" phase

- If some containers fail and don't get restarted, the Pod ends in "Failed" phase

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Replica Set

- Set of identical (replicated) Pods

- Defined by a pod template + number of desired replicas

- If there are not enough Pods, the Replica Set creates more

  (e.g. in case of node outage; or simply when scaling up)

- If there are too many Pods, the Replica Set deletes some

  (e.g. if a node was disconnected and comes back; or when scaling down)

- We can scale up/down a Replica Set

  - we update the manifest of the Replica Set

  - as a consequence, the Replica Set controller creates/deletes Pods

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Deployment

- Replica Sets control *identical* Pods

- Deployments are used to roll out different Pods

  (different image, command, environment variables, ...)

- When we update a Deployment with a new Pod definition:

  - a new Replica Set is created with the new Pod definition

  - that new Replica Set is progressively scaled up

  - meanwhile, the old Replica Set(s) is(are) scaled down

- This is a *rolling update*, minimizing application downtime

- When we scale up/down a Deployment, it scales up/down its Replica Set

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## `kubectl run` through the ages

- When we want to run an app on Kubernetes, we *generally* want a Deployment

- Up to Kubernetes 1.17, `kubectl run` created a Deployment

  - it could also create other things, by using special flags

  - this was powerful, but potentially confusing

  - creating a single Pod was done with `kubectl run --restart=Never`

  - other resources could also be created with `kubectl create ...`

- From Kubernetes 1.18, `kubectl run` creates a Pod

  - other kinds of resources can still be created with `kubectl create`

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Creating a Deployment the proper way

- Let's destroy that `pingpong` app that we created

- Then we will use `kubectl create deployment` to re-create it

.exercise[

- On Kubernetes 1.18+, delete the Pod named `pingpong`:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete pod pingpong
  ```

- On Kubernetes 1.17-, delete the Deployment named `pingpong`:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete deployment pingpong
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Running `ping` in a Deployment

<!-- ##VERSION## -->

- When using `kubectl create deployment`, we cannot indicate the command to execute

  (at least, not in Kubernetes 1.18; but that changed in Kubernetes 1.19)

- We can:

  - write a custom YAML manifest for our Deployment

--

  - (yeah right ... too soon!)

--

  - use an image that has the command to execute baked in

  - (much easier!)

--

- We will use the image `ahmedgabercod/ping`

  (it has a default command of `ping 127.0.0.1`)

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Creating a Deployment running `ping`

- Let's create a Deployment named `pingpong`

- It will use the image `ahmedgabercod/ping`

.exercise[

- Create the Deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment pingpong --image=ahmedgabercod/ping
  ```

- Check the resources that were created:
  ```bash
  kubectl get all
  ```

<!-- ```hide kubectl wait pod --selector=app=pingpong --for condition=ready ``` -->

- Since Kubernetes 1.19, we can specify the command to run

- The command must be passed after two dashes:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment pingpong --image=alpine -- ping 127.1
  ```

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Viewing container output

- Let's use the `kubectl logs` command

- We will pass either a *pod name*, or a *type/name*

  (E.g. if we specify a deployment or replica set, it will get the first pod in it)

- Unless specified otherwise, it will only show logs of the first container in the pod

  (Good thing there's only one in ours!)

.exercise[

- View the result of our `ping` command:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/pingpong
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Streaming logs in real time

- Just like `docker logs`, `kubectl logs` supports convenient options:

  - `-f`/`--follow` to stream logs in real time (à la `tail -f`)

  - `--tail` to indicate how many lines you want to see (from the end)

  - `--since` to get logs only after a given timestamp

.exercise[

- View the latest logs of our `ping` command:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/pingpong --tail 1 --follow
  ```

- Stop it with Ctrl-C

<!--
```wait seq=3```
```keys ^C```
-->

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Scaling our application

- We can create additional copies of our container (I mean, our pod) with `kubectl scale`

.exercise[

- Scale our `pingpong` deployment:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deploy/pingpong --replicas 3
  ```

- Note that this command does exactly the same thing:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment pingpong --replicas 3
  ```

- Check that we now have multiple pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Scaling a Replica Set

- What if we scale the Replica Set instead of the Deployment?

- The Deployment would notice it right away and scale back to the initial level

- The Replica Set makes sure that we have the right numbers of Pods

- The Deployment makes sure that the Replica Set has the right size

  (conceptually, it delegates the management of the Pods to the Replica Set)

- This might seem weird (why this extra layer?) but will soon make sense

  (when we will look at how rolling updates work!)

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Streaming logs of multiple pods

- What happens if we try `kubectl logs` now that we have multiple pods?

.exercise[

  ```bash
  kubectl logs deploy/pingpong --tail 3
  ```

]

`kubectl logs` will warn us that multiple pods were found.

It is showing us only one of them.

We'll see later how to address that shortcoming.

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Resilience

- The *deployment* `pingpong` watches its *replica set*

- The *replica set* ensures that the right number of *pods* are running

- What happens if pods disappear?

.exercise[

- In a separate window, watch the list of pods:
  ```bash
  watch kubectl get pods
  ```

<!--
```wait Every 2.0s```
```tmux split-pane -v```
-->

- Destroy the pod currently shown by `kubectl logs`:
  ```
  kubectl delete pod pingpong-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy
  ```

<!--
```tmux select-pane -t 0```
```copy pingpong-[^-]*-.....```
```tmux last-pane```
```keys kubectl delete pod ```
```paste```
```key ^J```
```check```
```key ^D```
```key ^C```
-->

]

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## What happened?

- `kubectl delete pod` terminates the pod gracefully

  (sending it the TERM signal and waiting for it to shutdown)

- As soon as the pod is in "Terminating" state, the Replica Set replaces it

- But we can still see the output of the "Terminating" pod in `kubectl logs`

- Until 30 seconds later, when the grace period expires

- The pod is then killed, and `kubectl logs` exits

.debug[[k8s/kubectl-run.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/kubectl-run.md)]
---

## Declarative vs Imperative

- With Kubernetes, we cannot say: "run this container"

- All we can do is write a *spec* and push it to the API server

  (by creating a resource like e.g. a Pod or a Deployment)

- The API server will validate that spec (and reject it if it's invalid)

- Then it will store it in etcd

- A *controller* will "notice" that spec and act upon it

.debug[[k8s/declarative.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/declarative.md)]
---

## Reconciling state

- Watch for the `spec` fields in the YAML files later!

- The *spec* describes *how we want the thing to be*

- Kubernetes will *reconcile* the current state with the spec
  <br/>(technically, this is done by a number of *controllers*)

- When we want to change some resource, we update the *spec*

- Kubernetes will then *converge* that resource

.debug[[k8s/declarative.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/declarative.md)]
---

## Deploying with YAML

- So far, we created resources with the following commands:

  - `kubectl run`

  - `kubectl create deployment`

- We can also create resources directly with YAML manifests

.debug[[k8s/declarative.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/declarative.md)]
---

## `kubectl apply` vs `create`

- `kubectl create -f whatever.yaml`

  - creates resources if they don't exist

  - if resources already exist, don't alter them
    <br/>(and display error message)

- `kubectl apply -f whatever.yaml`

  - creates resources if they don't exist

  - if resources already exist, update them
    <br/>(to match the definition provided by the YAML file)

  - stores the manifest as an *annotation* in the resource

.debug[[k8s/declarative.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/declarative.md)]
---

## Creating multiple resources

- The manifest can contain multiple resources separated by `---`

```yaml
 kind: ...
 apiVersion: ...
 metadata: ...
   name: ...
 ...
 ---
 kind: ...
 apiVersion: ...
 metadata: ...
   name: ...
 ...
```
.debug[[k8s/declarative.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/declarative.md)]
---

## Deleting resources

- We can also use a YAML file to *delete* resources

- `kubectl delete -f ...` will delete all the resources mentioned in a YAML file

  (useful to clean up everything that was created by `kubectl apply -f ...`)

- The definitions of the resources don't matter

  (just their `kind`, `apiVersion`, and `name`)

.debug[[k8s/declarative.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/declarative.md)]
---

## Pruning resources

- We can also tell `kubectl` to remove old resources

- This is done with `kubectl apply -f ... --prune`

- It will remove resources that don't exist in the YAML file(s)

- But only if they were created with `kubectl apply` in the first place

  (technically, if they have an annotation `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration`)

.debug[[k8s/declarative.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/declarative.md)]
---

## YAML as source of truth

- Imagine the following workflow:

  - do not use `kubectl run`, `kubectl create deployment`, `kubectl expose` ...

  - define everything with YAML

  - `kubectl apply -f ... --prune --all` that YAML

  - keep that YAML under version control

  - enforce all changes to go through that YAML (e.g. with pull requests)

- Our version control system now has a full history of what we deploy

- Compares to "Infrastructure-as-Code", but for app deployments

# Volumes

- Volumes are special directories that are mounted in containers

- Volumes can have many different purposes:

  - share files and directories between containers running on the same machine

  - share files and directories between containers and their host

  - centralize configuration information in Kubernetes and expose it to containers

  - manage credentials and secrets and expose them securely to containers

  - store persistent data for stateful services

  - access storage systems (like Ceph, EBS, NFS, Portworx, and many others)

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

class: extra-details

## Kubernetes volumes vs. Docker volumes

- Kubernetes and Docker volumes are very similar

  (the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) says otherwise ...
  <br/>
  but it refers to Docker 1.7, which was released in 2015!)

- Docker volumes allow us to share data between containers running on the same host

- Kubernetes volumes allow us to share data between containers in the same pod

- Both Docker and Kubernetes volumes enable access to storage systems

- Kubernetes volumes are also used to expose configuration and secrets

- Docker has specific concepts for configuration and secrets
  <br/>
  (but under the hood, the technical implementation is similar)

- If you're not familiar with Docker volumes, you can safely ignore this slide!

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Volumes ≠ Persistent Volumes

- Volumes and Persistent Volumes are related, but very different!

- *Volumes*:

  - appear in Pod specifications (we'll see that in a few slides)

  - do not exist as API resources (**cannot** do `kubectl get volumes`)

- *Persistent Volumes*:

  - are API resources (**can** do `kubectl get persistentvolumes`)

  - correspond to concrete volumes (e.g. on a SAN, EBS, etc.)

  - cannot be associated with a Pod directly; but through a Persistent Volume Claim

---

## Adding a volume to a Pod

- We will start with the simplest Pod manifest we can find

- We will add a volume to that Pod manifest

- We will mount that volume in a container in the Pod

- By default, this volume will be an `emptyDir`

  (an empty directory)

- It will "shadow" the directory where it's mounted

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Our basic Pod

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-without-volume
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

This is a MVP! (Minimum Viable Pod😉)

It runs a single NGINX container.

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Trying the basic pod

.exercise[

- Create the Pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f nginx-1-without-volume.yaml
  ```

<!-- ```bash kubectl wait pod/nginx-without-volume --for condition=ready ``` -->

- Get its IP address:
  ```bash
  IPADDR=$(kubectl get pod nginx-without-volume -o jsonpath={.status.podIP})
  ```

- Send a request with curl:
  ```bash
  curl $IPADDR
  ```

]

(We should see the "Welcome to NGINX" page.)

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Adding a volume

- We need to add the volume in two places:

  - at the Pod level (to declare the volume)

  - at the container level (to mount the volume)

- We will declare a volume named `www`

- No type is specified, so it will default to `emptyDir`

  (as the name implies, it will be initialized as an empty directory at pod creation)

- In that pod, there is also a container named `nginx`

- That container mounts the volume `www` to path `/usr/share/nginx/html/`

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## The Pod with a volume

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-with-volume
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: www
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - name: www
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html/
```

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Trying the Pod with a volume

.exercise[

- Create the Pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f nginx-2-with-volume.yaml
  ```

<!-- ```bash kubectl wait pod/nginx-with-volume --for condition=ready ``` -->

- Get its IP address:
  ```bash
  IPADDR=$(kubectl get pod nginx-with-volume -o jsonpath={.status.podIP})
  ```

- Send a request with curl:
  ```bash
  curl $IPADDR
  ```

]

(We should now see a "403 Forbidden" error page.)

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Populating the volume with another container

- Let's add another container to the Pod

- Let's mount the volume in *both* containers

- That container will populate the volume with static files

- NGINX will then serve these static files

- To populate the volume, we will clone the Spoon-Knife repository

  - this repository is https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife

  - it's very popular (more than 100K stars!)

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Sharing a volume between two containers

.small[
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-with-git
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: www
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - name: www
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html/
  - name: git
    image: alpine
    command: [ "sh", "-c", "apk add git && git clone https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife /www" ]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: www
      mountPath: /www/
  restartPolicy: OnFailure
```
]

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Sharing a volume, explained

- We added another container to the pod

- That container mounts the `www` volume on a different path (`/www`)

- It uses the `alpine` image

- When started, it installs `git` and clones the `octocat/Spoon-Knife` repository

  (that repository contains a tiny HTML website)

- As a result, NGINX now serves this website

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Trying the shared volume

- This one will be time-sensitive!

- We need to catch the Pod IP address *as soon as it's created*

- Then send a request to it *as fast as possible*

.exercise[

- Watch the pods (so that we can catch the Pod IP address)
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide --watch
  ```

<!--
```wait NAME```
```tmux split-pane -v```
-->

]

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Shared volume in action

.exercise[

- Create the pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f nginx-3-with-git.yaml
  ```

<!--
```bash kubectl wait pod/nginx-with-git --for condition=initialized```
```bash IP=$(kubectl get pod nginx-with-git -o jsonpath={.status.podIP})```
-->

- As soon as we see its IP address, access it:
  ```bash
  curl `$IP`
  ```

<!-- ```bash /bin/sleep 5``` -->

- A few seconds later, the state of the pod will change; access it again:
  ```bash
  curl `$IP`
  ```

]

The first time, we should see "403 Forbidden".

The second time, we should see the HTML file from the Spoon-Knife repository.

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Explanations

- Both containers are started at the same time

- NGINX starts very quickly

  (it can serve requests immediately)

- But at this point, the volume is empty

  (NGINX serves "403 Forbidden")

- The other containers installs git and clones the repository

  (this takes a bit longer)

- When the other container is done, the volume holds the repository

  (NGINX serves the HTML file)

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Volume lifecycle

- The lifecycle of a volume is linked to the pod's lifecycle

- This means that a volume is created when the pod is created

- This is mostly relevant for `emptyDir` volumes

  (other volumes, like remote storage, are not "created" but rather "attached" )

- A volume survives across container restarts

- A volume is destroyed (or, for remote storage, detached) when the pod is destroyed

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Persistent Volumes Claims

- Our Pods can use a special volume type: a *Persistent Volume Claim*

- A Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is also a Kubernetes resource

  (visible with `kubectl get persistentvolumeclaims` or `kubectl get pvc`)

- A PVC is not a volume; it is a *request for a volume*

- It should indicate at least:

  - the size of the volume (e.g. "5 GiB")

  - the access mode (e.g. "read-write by a single pod")

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## What's in a PVC?

- A PVC contains at least:

  - a list of *access modes* (ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany, ReadWriteMany)

  - a size (interpreted as the minimal storage space needed)

- It can also contain optional elements:

  - a selector (to restrict which actual volumes it can use)

  - a *storage class* (used by dynamic provisioning, more on that later)

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## What does a PVC look like?

Here is a manifest for a basic PVC:

```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
   name: my-claim
spec:
   accessModes:
     - ReadWriteOnce
   resources:
     requests:
       storage: 1Gi
```
.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Using a Persistent Volume Claim

Here is a Pod definition like the ones shown earlier, but using a PVC:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-using-a-claim
spec:
  containers:
  - image: ...
    name: container-using-a-claim
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /my-vol
      name: my-volume
  volumes:
  - name: my-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: my-claim
```

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Creating and using Persistent Volume Claims

- PVCs can be created manually and used explicitly

  (as shown on the previous slides)

- They can also be created and used through Stateful Sets

  (this will be shown later)

.debug[[k8s/volumes.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/volumes.md)]
---

## Lifecycle of Persistent Volume Claims

- When a PVC is created, it starts existing in "Unbound" state

  (without an associated volume)

- A Pod referencing an unbound PVC will not start

  (the scheduler will wait until the PVC is bound to place it)

- A special controller continuously monitors PVCs to associate them with PVs

- If no PV is available, one must be created:

  - manually (by operator intervention)

  - using a *dynamic provisioner* (more on that later)

# Configmaps | Secrets

- Some applications need to be configured (obviously!)

- There are many ways for our code to pick up configuration:

  - command-line arguments

  - environment variables

  - configuration files

  - configuration servers (getting configuration from a database, an API...)

  - ... and more (because programmers can be very creative!)

- How can we do these things with containers and Kubernetes?

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Passing configuration to containers

- There are many ways to pass configuration to code running in a container:

  - baking it into a custom image

  - command-line arguments

  - environment variables

  - injecting configuration files

  - exposing it over the Kubernetes API

  - configuration servers

- Let's review these different strategies!

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Baking custom images

- Put the configuration in the image

  (it can be in a configuration file, but also `ENV` or `CMD` actions)

- It's easy! It's simple!

- Unfortunately, it also has downsides:

  - multiplication of images

  - different images for dev, staging, prod ...

  - minor reconfigurations require a whole build/push/pull cycle

- Avoid doing it unless you don't have the time to figure out other options

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Command-line arguments

- Pass options to `args` array in the container specification

- Example ([source](https://github.com/coreos/pods/blob/master/kubernetes.yaml#L29)): 
  ```yaml
      args: 
        - "--data-dir=/var/lib/etcd"
        - "--advertise-client-urls=http://127.0.0.1:2379"
        - "--listen-client-urls=http://127.0.0.1:2379"
        - "--listen-peer-urls=http://127.0.0.1:2380"
        - "--name=etcd"
  ```

- The options can be passed directly to the program that we run ...

  ... or to a wrapper script that will use them to e.g. generate a config file

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Command-line arguments, pros & cons

- Works great when options are passed directly to the running program

  (otherwise, a wrapper script can work around the issue)

- Works great when there aren't too many parameters

  (to avoid a 20-lines `args` array)

- Requires documentation and/or understanding of the underlying program

  ("which parameters and flags do I need, again?")

- Well-suited for mandatory parameters (without default values)

- Not ideal when we need to pass a real configuration file anyway

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Environment variables

- Pass options through the `env` map in the container specification

- Example:
  ```yaml
      env:
      - name: ADMIN_PORT
        value: "8080"
      - name: ADMIN_AUTH
        value: Basic
      - name: ADMIN_CRED
        value: "admin:0pensesame!"
  ```

.warning[`value` must be a string! Make sure that numbers and fancy strings are quoted.]

🤔 Why this weird `{name: xxx, value: yyy}` scheme? It will be revealed soon!

## The downward API

- In the previous example, environment variables have fixed values

- We can also use a mechanism called the *downward API*

- The downward API allows exposing pod or container information

  - either through special files (we won't show that for now)

  - or through environment variables

- The value of these environment variables is computed when the container is started

- Remember: environment variables won't (can't) change after container start

- Let's see a few concrete examples!

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Exposing the pod's namespace

```yaml
    - name: MY_POD_NAMESPACE
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: metadata.namespace
```

- Useful to generate FQDN of services

  (in some contexts, a short name is not enough)

- For instance, the two commands should be equivalent:
  ```
  curl api-backend
  curl api-backend.$MY_POD_NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local
  ```

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Exposing the pod's IP address

```yaml
    - name: MY_POD_IP
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: status.podIP
```

- Useful if we need to know our IP address

  (we could also read it from `eth0`, but this is more solid)

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Exposing the container's resource limits

```yaml
    - name: MY_MEM_LIMIT
      valueFrom:
        resourceFieldRef:
          containerName: test-container
          resource: limits.memory
```

- Useful for runtimes where memory is garbage collected

- Example: the JVM

  (the memory available to the JVM should be set with the `-Xmx ` flag)

- Best practice: set a memory limit, and pass it to the runtime

- Note: recent versions of the JVM can do this automatically

  (see [JDK-8146115](https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=JDK-8146115))
  and
  [this blog post](https://very-serio.us/2017/12/05/running-jvms-in-kubernetes/)
  for detailed examples)

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## More about the downward API

- [This documentation page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/) tells more about these environment variables

- And [this one](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/downward-api-volume-expose-pod-information/) explains the other way to use the downward API

  (through files that get created in the container filesystem)

- That second link also includes a list of all the fields that can be used with the downward API

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Environment variables, pros and cons

- Works great when the running program expects these variables

- Works great for optional parameters with reasonable defaults

  (since the container image can provide these defaults)

- Sort of auto-documented

  (we can see which environment variables are defined in the image, and their values)

- Can be (ab)used with longer values ...

- ... You *can* put an entire Tomcat configuration file in an environment ...

- ... But *should* you?

(Do it if you really need to, we're not judging! But we'll see better ways.)

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]

## Injecting configuration files

- Sometimes, there is no way around it: we need to inject a full config file

- Kubernetes provides a mechanism for that purpose: `configmaps`

- A configmap is a Kubernetes resource that exists in a namespace

- Conceptually, it's a key/value map

  (values are arbitrary strings)

- We can think about them in (at least) two different ways:

  - as holding entire configuration file(s)

  - as holding individual configuration parameters

*Note: to hold sensitive information, we can use "Secrets", which
are another type of resource behaving very much like configmaps.
We'll cover them just after!*

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Configmaps storing entire files

- In this case, each key/value pair corresponds to a configuration file

- Key = name of the file

- Value = content of the file

- There can be one key/value pair, or as many as necessary

  (for complex apps with multiple configuration files)

- Examples:
  ```
  # Create a configmap with a single key, "app.conf"
  kubectl create configmap my-app-config --from-file=app.conf
  # Create a configmap with a single key, "app.conf" but another file
  kubectl create configmap my-app-config --from-file=app.conf=app-prod.conf
  # Create a configmap with multiple keys (one per file in the config.d directory)
  kubectl create configmap my-app-config --from-file=config.d/
  ```

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Configmaps storing individual parameters

- In this case, each key/value pair corresponds to a parameter

- Key = name of the parameter

- Value = value of the parameter

- Examples:
  ```
  # Create a configmap with two keys
  kubectl create cm my-app-config \
      --from-literal=foreground=red \
      --from-literal=background=blue
  
  # Create a configmap from a file containing key=val pairs
  kubectl create cm my-app-config \
      --from-env-file=app.conf
  ```

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]

## Exposing configmaps to containers

- Configmaps can be exposed as plain files in the filesystem of a container

  - this is achieved by declaring a volume and mounting it in the container

  - this is particularly effective for configmaps containing whole files

- Configmaps can be exposed as environment variables in the container

  - this is achieved with the downward API

  - this is particularly effective for configmaps containing individual parameters

- Let's see how to do both!

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Passing a configuration file with a configmap

- We will start a load balancer powered by HAProxy

- We will use the [official `haproxy` image](https://hub.docker.com/_/haproxy/)

- It expects to find its configuration in `/usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`

- We will provide a simple HAproxy configuration, `k8s/haproxy.cfg`

- It listens on port 80, and load balances connections between IBM and Google

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Creating the configmap

.exercise[

- Create a configmap named `haproxy` and holding the configuration file:
  ```bash
  kubectl create configmap haproxy --from-file=haproxy.cfg
  ```

- Check what our configmap looks like:
  ```bash
  kubectl get configmap haproxy -o yaml
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Using the configmap

We are going to use the following pod definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: haproxy
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: config
    configMap:
      name: haproxy
  containers:
  - name: haproxy
    image: haproxy
    volumeMounts:
    - name: config
      mountPath: /usr/local/etc/haproxy/
```

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Using the configmap

.exercise[

- Create the HAProxy pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f haproxy.yaml
  ```

<!-- ```hide kubectl wait pod haproxy --for condition=ready``` -->

- Check the IP address allocated to the pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod haproxy -o wide
  IP=$(kubectl get pod haproxy -o json | jq -r .status.podIP)
  ```

]

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---

## Testing our load balancer

- The load balancer will send:

  - half of the connections to Google

  - the other half to IBM

.exercise[

- Access the load balancer a few times:
  ```bash
  curl $IP
  curl $IP
  curl $IP
  ```

]

We should see connections served by Google, and others served by IBM.

## Passwords, tokens, sensitive information

- For sensitive information, there is another special resource: *Secrets*

- Secrets and Configmaps work almost the same way

  (we'll expose the differences on the next slide)

- The *intent* is different, though:

  *"You should use secrets for things which are actually secret like API keys, 
  credentials, etc., and use config map for not-secret configuration data."*

  *"In the future there will likely be some differentiators for secrets like rotation or support for backing the secret API w/ HSMs, etc."*

  (Source: [the author of both features](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36925553/580281
))

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---
## Differences between configmaps and secrets
 
- Secrets are base64-encoded when shown with `kubectl get secrets -o yaml`

  - keep in mind that this is just *encoding*, not *encryption*

  - it is very easy to extract and decode secrets

- [Secrets can be encrypted at rest](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/)

- With RBAC, we can authorize a user to access configmaps, but not secrets

  (since they are two different kinds of resources)

## Immutable ConfigMaps and Secrets

- Since Kubernetes 1.19, it is possible to mark a ConfigMap or Secret as *immutable*

  ```bash
  kubectl patch configmap xyz --patch='{"immutable": true}'
  ```

- This brings performance improvements when using lots of ConfigMaps and Secrets

  (lots = tens of thousands)

- Once a ConfigMap or Secret has been marked as immutable:

  - its content cannot be changed anymore
  - the `immutable` field can't be changed back either
  - the only way to change it is to delete and re-create it
  - Pods using it will have to be re-created as well

.debug[[k8s/configuration.md](file:///home/xeon/urgent/slides/k8s/configuration.md)]
---
## Exercise —

- Create a configMap called 'options' with the value server=local 
- Create a new nginx pod that loads the value from variable 'var5' in an env variable called 'option'
- Create a json file with the following content:
```
{
   "username": "YOUR_NAME",
   "password": "PASSWORD",
   "email": "YOUR_EMAIL"
}
```
   - Save the file as secret.json
   - Create a generic secret object from the file
   - Extract the password value from the secret and store it in password.txt
